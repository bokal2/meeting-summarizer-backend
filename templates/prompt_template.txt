I need to analyze and summarize a conversation. The transcript of the
conversation is between the <data> XML-like tags.

<data>
{{transcript}}
</data>

Please do the following:

1. Identify the main topic being discussed in the conversation.
2. Provide a concise summary of the meeting, highlighting the key points.
3. Include a one-word sentiment analysis.
4. List any issues, problems, or causes of friction that arose during the conversation.

Format the output in JSON as shown in the example below. Write only the JSON output and nothing more.

Example output:
{
    "topic": "<main_topic>",
    "meeting_summary": "<concise_summary_highlighting_main_points>",
    "sentiment": "<one_word_sentiment>",
    "issues": [
        {
            "topic": "<short_issue_topic>",
            "summary": "<description_of_the_issue>"
        }
    ]
}

Here is the JSON output:
